# Spring-Boot-JAVA-CRUD-
Spring Boot web application using Java
In this web application I have used Hashmap for storing and retrieving the data for easy understanding, you can you any data structure or database. 
I have designed code in such a way that in the class in which hashmap is defined you just have to put database code their and 
you are good to go.
This application is basically designed using JAVA, HTML and BOOTSTRAP.
